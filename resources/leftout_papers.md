We report below those 43 papers were not included in Table IV of our position paper. Specifically, these papers are those that were included in the Proceedings of either: ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS), IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP), Network and Distributed Systems Security Symposium (NDSS), USENIX Security Symposium (SEC) --- between 2019 and 2021. All such works were somewhat related to machine learning and cybersecurity, but fell outside the scope of our position paper (refer to Appendix B-A for an explanation).
