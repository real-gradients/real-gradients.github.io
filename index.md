Welcome to the website related to the paper _"Real Attackers Don't Compute Gradients": Bridging the Gap between Adversarial ML Research and Practice_ accepted to [IEEE SaTML'23](https://satml.org/).

We will [present the paper](https://satml.org/) in Raleigh (NC, USA) in February 2023!

### Resources

Alongside our main paper, our contributions also cover the following additional resources:

* **Screenshots** of the 100 "evasive" phishing webpages -- described in Section III.B. [[Archive]({{ BASE_PATH }}/resources/data/caseStudy2_screenshots.zip) (~17MB)] [[SHA256]({{ BASE_PATH }}/resources/data/caseStudy2_screenshots-SHA256)]
* **Source Material** of our analysis of the 2021 MLSEC antiphishing-evasion challenge -- described in Section III.A. [[Notebook](https://github.com/real-gradients/real-gradients.github.io/blob/main/resources/code/generate_plots.ipynb)] [[Submissions](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AiRbxLvsK4bMojLBxyzDoY3zY0CJ?e=nAQYF1)] [[SHA256]({{ BASE_PATH }}/resources/data/caseStudy3_submissions-SHA256) (~500MB)]
* **List of Excluded Papers** that entailed ML and Cybersecurity, but which fell outside our scope and were not included in our literature review -- refer to Appendix B-A. [[List]({{ BASE_PATH }}/resources/leftout_papers)]
